Song Library Application:

This application is very intutive, It allows the user to add new song and it's details, edit them, and delete them as well. It is made using JavaFX API and along with Simple JSON file that keeps track of all the data stored during the session the application runs. 

Requirements: 

JSON jar
Java SDK 11 and onwards
JavaFX 13

Currently only run on Eclipse EE 2019
Future Plan: convert it to a Desktop Application to discard any IDE requirement

Thank You for taking the time to review it :)
